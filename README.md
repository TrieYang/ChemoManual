# Chemotherapy Manual App

Welcome to the Chemotherapy Manual App! This application is designed to provide comprehensive information and assistance related to daily life during chemotherapy, aimed at providing advice for both patients and their families.

## Features

### üì± Main Page & Post Page
#### Just Browsing
The main page serves as a hub for accessing articles containing chemotherapy-related health advice and information posts. Users can browse through a variety of topics, ranging from treatment options to managing side effects. The posts are displayed with proper lining and fonts for best user experience.
#### Looking for something
The main page contains a search feature that allows users to look for information using keywords.

### üí¨ AI Chat Assistance Page
The AI-powered chatbot provides personalized assistance and immediate responses to questions. While it not being able to serve 100% medical purposes with accurate answers, it does provides some context and help for common questions relating to mental and physical health questions. Web scraping with OpenAI API is used to ensure patients in countries with internet restrictions are able to access the chat bot.

### üìö Category Page
The category page allows users to explore articles grouped by specific categories, making it easier to find information relevant to their needs. Categories may include topics such as exercise, mental health, diet, beauty etc...
